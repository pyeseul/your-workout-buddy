A repo for my workshop *Your Workout Buddy: PoseNet with ml5.js and p5.js* at the ITP Camp 2020

## Workshop Description

[Workshop Description on the ITP Camp 2020 website](https://itp.nyu.edu/camp2020/session/109)

If you've needed a stronger motivation to workout more at home, and if you want to learn to use PoseNet to track your body poses, this workshop is for you.
You'll learn how to read poses with a webcam, in other words, how to analyze and identify poses using PoseNet on ml5.js with p5.js. PoseNet is a machine learning model that allows for Real-time Human Pose Estimation and ml5.js is a friendly machine learning tool for the web.
You'll walk away with your own workout buddy (an interactive system lives on your laptop) who cheers you and gives you fun rewards when you workout.
Let's code and move our bodies together!!

## Workshop Notes

### PoseNet
- [PoseNet](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet) is a machine learning model that allows for Real-time Human Pose Estimation.
- [A high-level description of PoseNet running on Tensorflow.js](https://medium.com/tensorflow/real-time-human-pose-estimation-in-the-browser-with-tensorflow-js-7dd0bc881cd5) by Dan Oved

### PoseNet on ml5.js
- [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/) provides access to machine learning algorithms and models in the browser, building on top of TensorFlow.js with no other external dependencies.
- [PosetNet on ml5.js](https://learn.ml5js.org/docs/#/reference/posenet), which allows you to use PoseNet on p5.js
